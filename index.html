      <p>
        Yoda often orders sentences as Object-Subject-Verb, split verbs,
        switches entire phrases and sometimes uses sentences that are different
        from his normal syntax! Because of this it is difficult to accurately
        represent his sentence structure. But this app will translate English to
        Yoda speak. Have fun!
