# Yoda Speak Translator App

ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Welcome to Yoda Speak Translator App.

It is a fun translation app which translates English to Yoda speak, as Yoda often orders sentences as Object-Subject-Verb, split verbs, switches entire phrases and sometimes uses sentences that are different from his normal syntax!

This webapp is created using `Javascript` with the help of [funtranslations](https://funtranslations.com/) api and hosted using **Netlify**.

I have build it while learning web dev with [neoGcamp](https://neog.camp/)
